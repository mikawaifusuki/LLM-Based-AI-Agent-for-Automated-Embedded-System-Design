ADC0804 8-Bit Analog-to-Digital Converter

General Description:
The ADC0804 is a CMOS 8-bit successive approximation A/D converter that uses a differential potentiometric ladder, similar to the 256R products. It is designed to operate with the 8080A control bus via three-state outputs. The 8-bit A/D converter features a differential analog voltage input and an industry standard 8080A compatible control bus interface for easy connection to microprocessors.

Functional Description:
The ADC0804 contains an 8-bit A/D converter, 8-bit latch, and 3-state output buffer. The converter is designed to give accurate conversions to 8 bits with no missing codes. A conversion is initiated by pulling the CS and WR inputs low. The end of a conversion is indicated when the INTR output goes low. The microprocessor can read the conversion result by enabling the 3-state outputs through the CS and RD pins.

Connection to 8051 Microcontroller:
When interfacing with an 8051 microcontroller, the ADC0804 can be connected as follows:
- CS pin: Connected to a control pin on the 8051 (e.g., P2.0)
- RD pin: Connected to a control pin on the 8051 (e.g., P2.1)
- WR pin: Connected to a control pin on the 8051 (e.g., P2.2)
- INTR pin: Can be connected to an external interrupt pin on the 8051
- D0-D7: Can be connected to an 8-bit port on the 8051 (e.g., P1.0-P1.7)

For LM35 Temperature Sensor:
When using the ADC0804 with an LM35 temperature sensor, the LM35's output (which provides 10mV/°C) can be connected to the Vin(+) input, while Vin(-) is tied to ground. For better precision:
- Vref/2 can be used to adjust the voltage span
- For 0-100°C range with LM35, the 1V range would map to the full 8-bit range (255 counts)

Conversion Formula:
Digital Output = (Vin / Vref) × 255

Example: With LM35 at 25°C producing 250mV and using 5V reference:
Digital Output = (0.25V / 5V) × 255 = 12.75 ≈ 13 (decimal)
