AT89C51 8-bit Microcontroller with 4K Bytes Flash

General Description:
The AT89C51 is a low-power, high-performance CMOS 8-bit microcomputer with 4K bytes of Flash programmable and erasable read-only memory (PEROM). The device is manufactured using Atmel's high-density nonvolatile memory technology and is compatible with the industry-standard MCS-51 instruction set and pinout.

Features:
- Compatible with MCS-51 Products
- 4K Bytes of In-System Reprogrammable Flash Memory
- Fully Static Operation: 0 Hz to 24 MHz
- Three-level Program Memory Lock
- 128 x 8-bit Internal RAM
- 32 Programmable I/O Lines
- Two 16-bit Timer/Counters
- Six Interrupt Sources
- Programmable Serial Channel
- Low-power Idle and Power-down Modes

Pin Configuration:
- Port 0 (P0.0-P0.7): Pins 32-39 - Dual-purpose I/O port and external memory bus
- Port 1 (P1.0-P1.7): Pins 1-8 - Input/output port
- Port 2 (P2.0-P2.7): Pins 21-28 - Dual-purpose I/O port and external memory bus
- Port 3 (P3.0-P3.7): Pins 10-17 - Multi-function I/O port
  - P3.0 (RXD): Serial input port
  - P3.1 (TXD): Serial output port
  - P3.2 (INT0): External interrupt 0
  - P3.3 (INT1): External interrupt 1
  - P3.4 (T0): Timer 0 external input
  - P3.5 (T1): Timer 1 external input
  - P3.6 (WR): External data memory write strobe
  - P3.7 (RD): External data memory read strobe
- RST: Pin 9 - Reset input
- ALE: Pin 30 - Address Latch Enable
- PSEN: Pin 29 - Program Store Enable
- EA: Pin 31 - External Access Enable
- XTAL1: Pin 19 - Crystal input
- XTAL2: Pin 18 - Crystal output
- VCC: Pin 40 - Power supply (+5V)
- GND: Pin 20 - Ground (0V)

Clock and Timing:
The AT89C51 can operate with a clock frequency from 0 to 24 MHz. The standard crystal frequency is 11.0592 MHz for serial communication with standard baud rates.

Programming:
The Flash memory can be reprogrammed in-system or by conventional nonvolatile memory programmers. Program memory can be locked for security.

Power Management:
The AT89C51 has two software-selectable power saving modes:
- Idle Mode: CPU stops working while peripherals continue to function
- Power-down Mode: Saves RAM contents but freezes the oscillator

Common Applications:
- Industrial control systems
- Consumer electronics
- Automotive systems
- Smart appliances
- Educational systems

Crystal Connection:
To operate the AT89C51 with a crystal, connect a crystal oscillator between XTAL1 and XTAL2, and two capacitors (typically 22pF) from each crystal pin to ground.
